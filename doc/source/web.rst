Web server
==========

The easier way for the user to monitor and control the execution of the workflow is using the web interface. Once *wok-run.py* has been launched, if the configuration parameter **wok.server.enabled** is **true** (see configuration section for more details), the web server is started listening on **http://localhost:5000** by default. The user can put this address in any web browser and start navigating through different options. Before starting to navigate the user is asked for a password. By default it is *1234*, but it can be configured.
