Web server
==========

The easier way for the user to monitor and control the execution of the workflow
is using the web interface. Once *wok-run* has been launched, if the configuration
parameter **wok.server.enabled** is **true** (see configuration section for more details),
the web server is started listening on **http://localhost:5000** by default.
The user can put this address in any web browser and start navigating through
different options.
